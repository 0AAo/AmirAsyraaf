				<h2><span>Sand</span>box</h2>
				<p>The term “sandbox” may be more recognizable from its usage in tech or even as an open-ended mode available within certain games. The sandbox genre has grown from a small niche to encompass a huge variety of titles. Instead of beating the boss and saving the princess, you may face a variety of tasks you can accomplish in a number of different ways. This draws players into more immersive experiences, encouraging experimentation with what may be unfamiliar mechanics. It also showcased an early instance of procedural generation.<br><br>

				- Minecraft<br>
				- Grand Theft Auto<br>
				- The Sims<br></p>

				<h2>Real-time <span>strategy (RTS)</span></h2>
				<p>Originally  coined  as  a  marketing  term  for  Westwood  Studios’  Dune  II,  real-time  strategy  games  were  around  for  years  before  most  players  knew  what  the  genre  was.  Thanks to their enduring popularity and the growth of new sub-genres, RTS games remain a conspicuous part of the video game landscape.In  the  archetypal  RTS  title,  Dune  II  human  and  AI  players  control  different  factions  and  compete  against  each  other  simultaneously  in  “real  time”  hence  the  term  “real-time  strategy,”  as  opposed  to  turn-based  strategy.These games typically include resource and map management, and they often feature a top-down view.Warcraft,  Age  of  Empires,  and  Command  &  Conquer  are  among  the  most  popular  RTS  titles,  but  the  list  doesn’t  stop  there.And  when  it  comes  to  turn-based  strategy  games,  enthusiasts  tout  the  Civilization  series  and  other  notable  franchises.  There are also titles that deliberately blend elements of both styles for mixed gameplay, like the Total War franchise.<br><br>

				<h2>Shooters <span>(FPS and TPS)</span></h2>
				<p>The shooter is another long-standing genre that developed several early offshoots and branched out into two primary sub-genres. There's plenty of potential for overlap here, too, since many contemporary titles allow you to toggle between first and third-person viewpoints. An FPS simulates a typical human viewpoint, while a TPS pulls the perspective back and showcases your entire character and surrounding environment.<br><br>

				<p>MOBAs are an increasingly popular subgenre with connections to a variety of other styles. The major difference between MOBAs and RTS games is the player's character and role. While some well-known titles feature AI-controlled elements, you usually play against humans. The niche is dominated by Dota 2 and League of Legends, both of which have developed substantial audiences in eSports.<br><br>

				<h2>Role-playing <span>(RPG, ARPG, and More)</span></h2>
				<p>Role-playing games are a cornerstone of gaming, but no single game can represent the genre. With that in mind, here are the most popular sub-genres with a short explanation for each. RPGs: You create or take control of a character that you can then level up through experience points. The basic premise of the role-playing game is simple and ubiquitous in numerous games.
				<br>
				RPG: Encompasses a variety of different niches and sub-genres, ranging from tabletop gaming with cards and dice (Dungeons & Dragons) to video game RPGs (Fallout).
				<br>
				ARPG: Action RPGs have a strong emphasis on combat but include many of the characteristics of a standard RPG, like The Witcher 3.
				<br>
				CRPG: “Computer RPG” is typically used to describe Western-developed RPGs created for PC gamers, like the first two Fallout games.
				<br>
				MMORPG: Combines the massively multiplayer online genre format with RPG gameplay, with notable titles like World of Warcraft, EVE Online, and Elder Scrolls Online.
				<br>
				TRPG: Short for tactical role-playing game, TRPGs resemble strategy games but place a deeper emphasis on creative thinking and short-term decision making, like the XCOM series.
				<br>
				Roguelike: Strict definitions feature turn-based gameplay, some form of permadeath, tile graphics, and procedural generation. However, many newer and popular examples, like The Binding of Isaac and Spelunky, focus more on action and platforming, respectively.
				<br>
				Roguelite: Does not include one or more key elements of a typical roguelike. Definitions for this sub-genre will vary, but Rogue Legacy is a widely accepted example.
				<br>
				<br>
				RPG examples:
				<br>
				Skyrim
				<br>
				The Witcher 3 (ARPG)
				<br>
				Fallout 4

				<h2>Simulation <span>and sports</span></h2>
				<p>With advances in graphics technology, sports and simulation games have become increasingly immersive experiences. The latest iterations provide impressive levels of detail and showcase just how much is possible with games. Sports games have expanded in variety, offering full-fledged partnerships with major sporting organizations. NBA 2K and Madden NFL are two well-known examples that feature detailed recreations of professional basketball and football. Forza is a simulation-style car racing game.<br><br>Sim and sport examples:<br>

				<h2>Puzzlers and <span>party games</span></h2>
				<p>Puzzlers and party games have a significant overlap, with both emphasizing game mechanics. You can expect to play a game based on a theme or a traditional tabletop game with particular rule sets. Party games take that premise a little further and often include multiplayer elements. The Mario Party series is particularly popular, and it spawned more than 10 installments and spin-offs.<br><br>

				Jackbox Party Pack (party game)<br>
				The Talos Principle (puzzler)<br>

				<h2>Action-<span>adventure</span></h2>
				<p>Action-adventure games have a deep focus on plot and combat through story involvement and tight gameplay mechanics. Many games can fit into this category, including the classic Legend of Zelda franchise that paved the way for numerous franchises. Adventure games typically involve players solving mysteries or puzzles in a first-person perspective. Think of classic titles like Escape From Monkey Island, King's Quest, and Day Of The Tentacle.<br><br>

				Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order<br>
				Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice<br>

				<h2>Survival <span>and horror</span></h2>
				<p>Survival and horror games have a lot of overlap, to the point that they even created their own sub-genre (survival horror). In particular, horror games often share some basic features with their survival counterparts. As developers add more FPS and conventional shooter features to certain horror and survival titles, there's ongoing debate about how to define these genres.<br><br>

				The Long Dark<br>
				Don’t Starve<br>

				<p>The platformer genre covers a huge variety of games that still proudly showcase their roots in the earliest 2D side-scrollers. Platformers involve running, climbing, and jumping as the player explores and works their way through challenging levels. Ori and the Blind Forest is a popular example that incorporates puzzles and adventure elements, while Cuphead is both beautifully animated and deeply challenging.<br><br>
